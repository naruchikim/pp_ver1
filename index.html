                    By Congress trying to defund Planned Parenthood, legislators are essiently <i>preventing patients</i> who rely on public health care programs (such as Medicaid and Title X) <i>from getting essential reproductive health care</i>. About 60% of PP patients reply on these programs to get care, and if they are successful and defunding it, millions (remember, they cater to 2.4 million people every year) would lose access to things such as cancer screenings, birth control, and STD testing and treatments. Defunding PP would also <i>make safe abortion unavailable</i> to the general public.
